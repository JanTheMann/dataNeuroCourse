## Objective

The aim is to understand what machine learning is and experiment with a few examples. 


## Definition of machine learning

Machine learning is the field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitely programmed.

-- Arthur Samuel, 1959

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. 

-- Tom Mitchell, 1997

Examples : A program learns to decide whether an email is spam or not based on training set. 

## Definition of machine learning


* $p$ different inputs (predictors): $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3},...,X_{p}$
* Response: $Y$
* Unknown function: $f()$
* Random error: $\epsilon$

<center>
$Y = f(X) + \epsilon$
</center>

<br>
Machine learning refers to a set of approaches for estimating $f$.


## Prediction versus inference

Why do we want to estimate $f$?

<center>
$\hat Y = \hat f(X)$
</center>

### Prediction
* We focus on predicting $Y$ ($\hat Y$).
* $\hat f$ is treated as a black box.

### Inference
* Understand how $Y$ is affected as $X_{1},..., X_{p}$ changes.
* Which predictors are associated with the response?
* Is the relation between $Y$ and each predictor adequately summarized using a linear equation?


## Supervised versus unsupervised versus reinforcement learning

### Supervised
* The training set contains labelled data.
* For each observation of the predictors $X_{i}, i = 1,...,n$ there is a known response measurement $y_{i}$.
* Example: linear regression

### Unsupervised
* Uncovering hidden patterns from unlabelled data.
* For each observation $i = 1,...,n$, we observed a vector of measurments $X_{i}$, but no response $y_{i}$.
* Example: cluster analysis

## Regression versus classification

* If $Y$ is a continuous variable, then it is a regression task.
* If $Y$ is a categorical variable, then it is a classification task.

## Training and test sets

A **training set** is our observed data points that is used to estimate $f$. Our training set has $n$ observations.

A **test set** is used to test how accurate our model is. Not used for training!

## Time for a quizz!

## Our task

The mice performing rewarded alternation on the t-maze appeared to have improved their performance across the training blocks. Can we estimate how much they improved between each block?

```{r load}
myFile="~/repo/dataNeuroCourse/dataSets/tmaze.csv" 
df<-read_csv(myFile)
df<-mutate(df, correct = sample != choice)

df1 <- df %>% 
  group_by(mouse,block) %>% 
  summarise(performance = 100 * mean(correct))
```

## Our data

```{r ourData,fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
df1 %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=block,y=performance)) +
  geom_point(position="jitter")
```

What analysis could we do to estimate the rate of improvment in performance?

## Linear regression

* A line as a model for our data.
* $Y = aX + b$
* $Y$: target
* $X$: features (inputs)
* $a$ and $b$ are parameters of the model.
* $a$ is the slope and $b$ is the intercept.
* The task is to find the best $a$ and $b$.
* Define an error or loss function to assess any possible line ($a$ and $b$).
* Find the line ($a$ and $b$) that minimize the error function.

## Linear regression

* In real life, use the function `lm()` to find the regression line (best fit). 

* But not today. 

* To better understand how machine learning works, we will do it step-by-step.

## Example of a line

```{r line, fig.width = 3,fig.height = 3}
a=2 # slope
b=5 # intercept
X=seq(from = 0, to = 35, by = 1) # some input values in X
df<-data.frame(X = X, Y = X * a + b) # our line formula
df %>% ggplot(mapping=aes(x=X,y=Y)) +
  geom_line() +
  xlim(0,80) +
  ylim(0,80) 
  
```

## Which line is the best fit for our data?

```{r lines, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2}
set.seed(30)
models<-tibble( # create a data frame with 1000 random lines
  a = runif(n = 1000, min = -2, max = 5), # slope
  b = runif(n = 1000, min = 40, max = 70) # intercept
)
ggplot()+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance),position="jitter", data=df1)+
  geom_abline(mapping=aes(intercept=b, slope=a), alpha=0.1, data=models)+
  xlim(0,14)+
  ylim(20,105)
```

Many of our models are pretty bad!

## Cost (loss) function

* Based on residuals.
* Residuals: difference between the observed value and the predicted value (line).
* Often used: Sum of the squares of residuals
* Find the line which minimise the loss function

```{r lm,echo=FALSE,fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3}
dm<-df1
# add a bit of noise to block so that the points are not on top of each other
dm$block<-dm$block + runif(n = length(df1$block), min = -0.5, max = 0.5)
# fit a linear model to the data
fit<-lm(performance~block,data = dm)
# get predicted values and residuals
dm$predicted<-predict(fit)
dm$residuals<-residuals(fit)
# plot 
ggplot(data=dm, mapping = aes(x=block,y=performance))+
  geom_segment(aes(xend = block, yend = predicted),alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red")
```


## Cost function

Let's write a function that will give us the predictions of a model.

```{r prediction}
# define a function
one_model_predictions<-function(a, b, data){ 
  # parameters are a and b
  # data should be our input X
  a * data$block  + b # y = a * x + b
}

# prediction of the model y = 5 * x + 50
one_model_predictions(a=5, b=50, data=df1)
```

## Cost function

Calculate the difference between the actual and predicted y values. Return residual sum of squares (RSS).

```{r difference}
measure_distance <- function(a, b, data){
  diff <- data$performance - one_model_predictions(a, b,data)
  sum(diff^2)
}

dist <- measure_distance(a=5, b=50, data=df1)
print(paste("Residual sum of squares: ",dist))
```

## Best fitting lines

Measure the distance between the prediction of all models and the observed performance

```{r distance_all}
models <- models %>%
  mutate(dist = purrr::map2_dbl(a,b,measure_distance,df1))
# purrr::map2_dbl() calls measure_distance for each row of models
head(models,n=5)
```

## Best fitting lines

Which model is the best fit?

```{r best_fit}
models %>% 
  filter(rank(dist)<=8) %>% 
  arrange(dist)
```

## Best fitting line

```{r best_fit2, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance),position="jitter", 
             data=df1) +
  geom_abline(mapping=aes(intercept=b, slope=a), alpha=0.1, 
              data=filter(models,rank(dist)<=8)) +
  xlim(0,14) +
  ylim(20,105)
```

This is way better!

## Our parameter search

Our machine learning algorithm found the best fits.

```{r best_fit3, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2}
ggplot(data=models, mapping = aes(x=a,y=b)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=-dist),alpha=0.2) +
  geom_point(data=filter(models,rank(dist)<=10),color="red") +
  geom_point(data=filter(models,rank(dist)<=1),color="blue") 
```

## Compare our results to lm()

```{r best_fit4}
models %>% 
  filter(rank(dist)==1)
myFittedModel<-lm(performance~block, data=df1)
myFittedModel
```

## lm()

```{r summary}
summary(myFittedModel)
```


## Compare our results to lm()

```{r compare,fig.width = 3, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(data=df1,mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance)) +
  geom_point(position="jitter") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  geom_abline(mapping = aes(slope=a,intercept = b),data=filter(models,rank(dist)==1))
```

Impressively close! Would be closer with a better samples of lines.
