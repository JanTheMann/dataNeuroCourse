## Today's plan

1. Review exercises
2. Saving you code as .R files.
3. git repositories (create one!)
3. dplyr
4. Example: Analysis of behavioural data


## tidyverse

`tidyverse` is a collection of R packages for data science.

Advantages of tidyverse over built-in core R functions

1. Code is easier to understand 
2. Code is easier to read 
3. Easier to learn

Disadvantage

1. You need to load it before starting coding
2. You need tidy data frames

## tidyverse

```{r tidy1, results = 'hide'}
library(tidyverse)
```
