## Course introduction

This course is an introduction to data science and analysis in Neuroscience. 

The objectives are as follows:
1. 
2. 
3. 

The theorical part of the course is largely based on [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and on [An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1461471370). The first book is freely available on the web or as a pdf. The second is not free.

To become better at data analysis, you need to practice. Therefore, a significant portion of the course will be spent coding, either in the classroom or at home. For most of these exercises, we will use neuroscience data sets. After you have a go at an exercise, we will quickly review it and try to answer any questions you might have.

At the end of each class, there will be some exercises and/or readings to complete before the next class.

There are many great languages and programing environments available today, but we can't cover them all in one short course. Therefore, we will focus mainly on R and RStudio. We will only briefly use python to try out a pose estimator program called [deeplabcut](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut).

## Introduction to R 

In RStudio, you can perform simple calculation as you would expect.
```{r example1,eval=FALSE}
4+9
(360+50)/2
```

You can create an object to store a value using <-. You can display the value stored in an object by simply writing its name, or using print().
```{r example2,eval=T}
x<-10+50
x
print(x)
```

You can use several built in functions that are part of R. For a list of function that are part of the core of R, see the cheatsheat.
```{r example3}
sin(x)
abs(-100)
seq(1,10)
c(1,2,3,6,7,8)
```

There are different types of objects in R. The most commons are numerics, characters, factors, logicals, lists, data.frames. You can know the type of an object with class(objectName).
```{r example4}
class(x)
y<-"neuroscience"
class(y)
```

TRICK: You can use tab to complete the name of a fonction in RStudio.

## Data frames

Most of the time, we will be working with data frames. Data frames are just like tables. They can have several columns and rows. A row usually represents one observation (e.g., the data from one trial or one subject). A column usually contains a variable (e.g., the height of your subjects). A cell contain a single value.

```{r dataFrame1}
# weight and height of 3 subjects
data.frame(height=c(170,188,150),weight=c(72,90,50))
```
Whenever possible, organize your data frame with one entry per row and one variable per column. This will make your analysis much simpler. 

## Tidyverse

With programming, there are ususally several possible ways to perfrom one task. Feel free to explore as much ways as you can. In the course, I will encourage the use of a group of packages called tidyverse.

Compared to core R functions, tidyverse makes it easier to understand what your code does. It makes your code easier to read. It is also easier to learn.

tidyverse is not part of the core R, you need to load the packages whenever you want to use it. This is done with the library() function.

Similarly, I will use the package ggplot2 to visualize data. This package is also part of tidyverse. 

Large part of what we will cover is part of the book "R for Data Science" from Haddley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund

```{r tidy1}
library(tidyverse)
```
## A very short introduction to ggplot2



## Data transformation with dplyr

We will now learn how to play with your dataframe.




```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
