## Today's plan

1. Consolidation of dplyr and ggplot
2. Saving a graph
3. Plot with several graphs
4. git: create your git repository on github
5. Relational data with dplyr

## dplyr and ggplot

Load the tmaze data set for a few more exercises.

```{r load}
myFile="~/repo/dataNeuroCourse/dataSets/tmaze.csv" 
df<-read_csv(myFile)
df<-mutate(df, correct = sample != choice)
```

## dplyr and ggplot

The is a possibility that some mice had a bad performance because they always visited the same goal arm instead of alternating. 

How could we process the data to get a score per mouse telling us if the mouse always choose the same arm?


## Break down your programming task into smaller tasks.

* Which column contains this information?
* How can we go from the values in this column to a statistic (number)?
* Once you have the information, choose a plot?

Alternatively

* Imagine which plot would convey your message best (draw some on paper)
* Find out which steps are needed to produce this graph.

***

To get a statistic, we need to transform a `chr` to something we can count (e.g., `dbl` or `lgl`).
Change `R` and `L` to `0` and `1` using `ifelse`.

```{r noAlternation1}
df <- df %>% mutate(turn = ifelse( choice == "R" , 0, 1))
head(df,n=5)
```

***

Now summarize this information as a new variable for each mouse on each block.

Also get the performance from the `correct` column, as done last week.

***

```{r noAlternation2, out.width = "800px"}
df1 <- df %>% 
  group_by(mouse,block) %>% 
  summarise(nonAlternance = mean(turn),performance = mean(correct))
df1
```

***

To know if mice prefer left or right turns, plot the distribution of nonAlternation.

*** 

```{r noAlternation3,out.width = "500px"}
df1 %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = nonAlternance),binwidth = 0.1)
```

Mice have a small tendency to turn right in our experimental room.

***

Plot the performance and nonAlternation to see how the two variables are related.

***

```{r noAlternation4,out.width = "500px"}
df1 %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = nonAlternance, y = performance))
```

Most points are on top of each other. This is called [overplotting](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/overplotting.html). 

Try solving this by setting `position="jitter"` or `alpha=0.1`.

*** 

```{r noAlternation5,out.width = "400px"}
df1 %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = nonAlternance, y = performance),
             position = "jitter") +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = nonAlternance, y = performance),
              method = "loess")
```

The geom_smooth helps you see the pattern in the data.

If a mouse always goes to the same goal arm (e.g., left), it won't be performing well.


***

Plot the nonAlternance on every block for every mice, with our chance lever line at 0.5.

*** 

```{r nonAlternance6,out.width = "400px"}
df1 %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(mapping=aes(x=block,y=nonAlternance)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, alpha=0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~mouse)
```

Most mice had a tendency to turn left, but one (Mn7735) had a persistent tendency to turn right.

Can you add the performance to this graph?

***


```{r nonAlternance8,out.width = "400px"}
df1 %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance) ) +
  geom_line(mapping=aes(x=block,y=nonAlternance),color="blue",alpha=0.3) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, alpha=0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~mouse)
```

***

```{r nonAlternance7,out.width = "600px"}
df %>% 
  group_by(mouse) %>% 
  summarise(nonAlternance = mean(turn),performance = mean(correct)) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=nonAlternance,y=performance)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label=mouse),hjust=-0.1,vjust=0.5) +
  xlim(0.2,0.8)
```

## dplyr and ggplot

You are now able to use dplyr and ggplot to extract meaningful information from a dataset!!!

Time to share these nice graphs (export).

## Saving a graph

```{r save1, echo=FALSE,out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio-export-figure.png")
```

## Saving a graph

`ggsave()` saves the latest plot that was displayed

```{r save2,  fig.width = 3,fig.height=2,results=FALSE}
df1 %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance,group=block))

myFileName="/home/kevin/Downloads/myPlot.pdf"
ggsave(filename = myFileName,
       device = "pdf", units = "cm", 
       width = 10, height = 10)
```


## Plot with several graphs

* Store graphs as variables

```{r sevGraphs1, fig.width = 3,fig.height=2}
p1<- df1 %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance,group=block),color="blue")+
  ggtitle("Performance per block")
```

```{r sevGraphs2,fig.width = 3,fig.height=2}
p1
```

## Plot with several graphs

Let's store several graphs in variables p1, p2, p3 and p4.

```{r, sevGraphs3}
p1 <- df %>%
  group_by(mouse, block) %>%
  summarise(nTrials = n(), performance = mean(correct)) %>%
  filter(nTrials == 10) %>% 
  ggplot () +
    geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = performance), binwidth = 0.01) +
    xlab("Performance (prob.)") +
    ylab("Count")
```

***

```{r sevGraphs4}
p2 <- df %>% group_by(mouse,block) %>% 
  summarise(performance = mean(correct)*100) %>%
  group_by(block) %>% 
  summarise(global_performance = mean(performance)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(mapping=aes(x=block,y=global_performance),color="blue")+
  ylim(40,100) +
  xlab("Block") +
  ylab("Performance (%)")+
  geom_hline(mapping = aes(yintercept=50),linetype="dashed")
```

***

```{r sevGraphs5}
p3 <-df %>% group_by(mouse,block) %>% 
  summarise(performance = mean(correct)*100) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_point(mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance)) +
    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance),color = "blue") +
    ylab("Performance (%)") +
    xlab("Block") +
    geom_hline(mapping = aes(yintercept=50),linetype="dashed") +
    facet_wrap(~mouse)
```

***

```{r sevGraphs6}
p4 <- df %>% group_by(mouse,block) %>% 
  summarise(performance = mean(correct)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance*100,group=block),color="blue") +
  ylab("Performance (%)") +
  xlab("Block")
```

***

Now put these graphs together.

```{r sevGraphs7, fig.width = 6,fig.height=4}
#install.packages("gridExtra")
library(gridExtra)
```

***
  
```{r sevGraphs8, fig.width = 6,fig.height=5}
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2)
```

***
  
Use `pdf()` and `dev.off()` to save your new creation.

```{r sevGraphs9}
myFileName="/home/kevin/Downloads/allMyPlots.pdf"
pdf(file=myFileName,paper = "a4") # open the file
all_ps <- grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2) # write
dev.off() # close the file
```

I usually add the final touch to the graphs using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

## git: install 

Make sure you save any R script open in RStudio. 

Install git on your computer

* Windows and Mac: (http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* linux: `sudo apt-get install git-core`

Example for Windows : Download for Windows, Run executable, license next,  default location, will install git bash. Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt, 3 x next with default

## Set up RStudio

1. Go to Global Options (from the Tools menu)
2. Click Git/SVN
3. Click Enable version control interface for RStudio projects

For more [information](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN)

2. Log in
3. Click New repository
4. Set repository name: myNotesDataScience, set to private, check Initialize this repository with a README
5. Click Create repository

## Create a project with RStudio from your repository

1. Copy the urs of your repository from the github web site. It ends with `.git`
2. Open RStudio, New Project..., Version Control, Git, 
3. Enter the url and set directory.
4. Create project.

1. Click on commit.
2. Make sure `myNotesDataScience.Rproj` is staged.
3. Set commit message to `my first commit`
4. Click commit
5. Click on the up arrow to push your commit to the online repository.
6. Refresh your web browser to see `myNotesDataScience.Rproj` online.

<!-- ## Set up git for your new repository 
  1. Launch git bash.
2. type `cd` and `enter`
3. type `mkdir repo` to create a directory called `repo` in your home directory.
4. `cd repo`
5. `git config --global user.name "Your name"`
6. `git config --global user.email "youremail@hello.com"`
-->
## Next steps with git...

All you will have to do most of the time.

1. Save the file with your R code in your project directory.
2. Stage the file
3. Commit
4. Push

## Relational data with dplyr

In most project, you need to work with several tables. 

Relations are defined between a pair of tables.

## Relational data with dplyr

Let's assign a genotype to each mouse in a new data frame.

```{r relational1}
dfGeno<-tibble(mouse=c("Mn4656","Mn848","Mn4672","Mn4673",
                           "Mn7712","Mn7735","Mn829"),
           genotype=c("wt","wt","wt","wt",
                      "ko","ko","ko"))
dfGeno
```

***

How is `df` related to `dfGeno`?

```{r relational2}
colnames(df)
colnames(dfGeno)
colnames(dfGeno)[colnames(dfGeno) %in% colnames(df)]
```
`mouse` is a **key**, a variable that connect a pair of tables.

***

* A **primary key** uniquely identifies an observation in its table.

```{r relational3}
dfGeno %>% 
  count(mouse)

```

***

* A **foreign key** uniquely identifies an observation in *another* table.

```{r relational4}
df %>% 
  count(mouse)
```

## Mutating joins

* It first matches observation by their keys.
* Then copies across variables from one table to the other.

```{r relational5}
df<- df %>% 
  left_join(dfGeno,by="mouse") # match with mouse
view(df)
```
We now have an additional variable (genotype) in df.

## (End - 1)

This is all for today. 

Time to use `git` to `commit` and `push` your changes to your online repository.
